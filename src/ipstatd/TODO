- Reliable communication, probably already done.
- configuration file parsing.
- code cleanup & security auditing
	strlen -> memchr
- carefully read man snprintf, strncpy->strlcpy,
  strlcat, syslog(%m)!!! (about return values) fix security bugs.
  security auditing done for dumpstat.c
  must be done at least for ipstatd.c net.c
  signal handlers!
  64bit counters
- errx/warnx in *BSD versions.
- prototype functions.
- stop -> stop_server or some other name.
- style as suggested in OpenBSD's style(9).
- carefully rewrite parse_ip()
- Portability
- ipchains support.
- libpcap support
- profiling & optimization.
- BSD port.
- statistic format via config
- flex configuration for per interface accounting...
- documentation :)
- ipv6 support.

Need to fix some BUGS and add futures to ipfilter logging:
- poll & select must work properly.
- ipl must be accessible by many processes.
- logging rewriting ( breakage linked list )
- ipl_count must be removed or hash must contain size and other fields.
