		KNOWN PROBLEMS

You can have only one card of the same type. Ie if you have two aztech FM
tuners, one with jumper set to port 0x358 and second - to 0x350, you can
use only one aztech card (in the kernel, that is) either with port 0x350
or 0x358. Don't even try to compile support for the second card into the
kernel.
