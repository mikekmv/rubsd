high-level /dev/radio device driver

		AVALIABLE DRIVERS

SoundForte RadioLink SF64-PCR FM Radio Card device driver
	state: fully functional ?, absolutely not tested
SoundForte RadioLink SF16-FMR2 FM Radio Card device driver
	state: fully functional, testing
Aztech/PackardBell FM radio Card device driver
	state: fully functional, testing
Guillemot Maxi Radio FM2000 PCI Radio Card device driver
	state: not functional, skeleton

		KNOWN PROBLEMS

You can have only one card of the same type. Ie if you have two aztech FM
tuners, one with jumper set to port 0x358 and second - to 0x350, you can
use only one aztech card (in the kernel, that is) either with port 0x350
or 0x358. Don't even try to compile support for the second card into the
kernel.

		INSTALLATION

1) apply patch29 on the kernel source tree
2) copy files from the sys directory to appropriate locations in the kernel
   source tree
3) configure your kernel
4) compile and install the new kernel
5) apply MAKEDEV.patch
6) cd /dev && ./MAKEDEV radio (for /dev/radio)
   for /dev/radio1 do ./MAKEDEV radio1 and so on...
8) compile and install radioctl
9) reboot

		KERNEL CONFIG EXAMPLES

option RADIO_INIT_VOL=255		# Max volume
option RADIO_INIT_MUTE=0		# Unmute on boot
option RADIO_INIT_FREQ=106300		# 106.3 MHz, that is
option RADIO_TEA5759			# Japanese variant of TEA5757
