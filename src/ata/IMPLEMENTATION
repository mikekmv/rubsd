There are 3 abstract layers planned:

# Physycal PCI IDE controller, analog of existing pciide device
atapci* at pci?

# The same for ISA bus, analog of existing wdc device
ataisa* at isa?

# ATA bus device
ata* at atapci?
ata* at ataisa?

# ATA disk
ad* at ata?

The ata device is a core of ATA subsystem. It translates ATA commands
from the ad device into the operations with ata{pci,isa}'s registers.
