.Sh NAME
.Nm trafd
.Nd IP/IPv6 traffic collector
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm trafd
.Op Fl dOp
.Op Fl i Ar interface
.Op Ar expression
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is an IP/IPv6 traffic collector daemon; it listens on a network
interface for IP/IPv6 packets that match the boolean
.Ar expression
(see
.Xr tcpdump 8
for more information) and collects the following statistics:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
protocol family (INET/INET6)
.It
IP/IPv6 protocol number
.It
source IP/IPv6 address
.It
source TCP/UDP port
.It
destination IP/IPv6 address
.It
destination TCP/UDP port
.It
total number of bytes trasferred
.El
.Pp
Kernel must be compiled with
.Xr bpf 4
(Berkeley Packet Filter) support.
.Pp
The options are follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize
.Nm trafd ,
log messages to stderr.
.It Fl i Ar interface
Listen on
.Ar interface .
If unspecified,
.Nm
searches the system interface list for the lowest numbered,
configured
.Dq up
interface (excluding loopback).
.It Fl O
Do not run the packet-matching code optimizer.
This is useful only if you suspect a bug in the optimizer.
.It Fl p
Do not put the interface into promiscuous mode.
.El
.Sh SIGNALS
The following signals recognized by
.Nm trafd :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, SIGINT
.It Pa SIGINFO
Log number of received and dropped packets.
.It Pa SIGHUP
Save collected traffic statistics to a dump file.
.It Pa SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGTERM
Log number of received and dropped packets, save collected
statistics to a dump file and exit.
.Sh BUGS
Sure ;)
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/trafd/trafd-netifX.pid -compact
.It Pa /var/trafd/trafd-netifX.pid
process ID of running
.Nm
listening on netifX.
.It Pa /var/trafd/traffic.netifX
traffic dump file for netifX.
