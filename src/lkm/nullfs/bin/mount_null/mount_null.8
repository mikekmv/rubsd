.Dt MOUNT_NULL 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_null
.Nd mount the null filesystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_null
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Ar target
.Ar mount-point
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command creates a
null layer, duplicating a sub-tree of the file system
name space under another part of the global file system namespace.
This allows existing files and directories to be accessed
using a different pathname.
.Pp
The primary differences between a virtual copy of the filesystem
and a symbolic link are that the
.Xr getcwd 3
functions work correctly in the virtual copy, and that other filesystems
may be mounted on the virtual copy without affecting the original.
A different device number for the virtual copy is returned by
.Xr stat 2 ,
but in other respects it is indistinguishable from the original.
.Pp
The
.Nm null
filesystem differs from a traditional
loopback file system in two respects: it is implemented using
a stackable layers techniques, and its
.Do null-node Dc Ns s
stack above
all lower-layer vnodes, not just over directory vnodes.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl o
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
See the
.Xr mount 8
man page for possible options and their meanings.
.El
.Pp
The null layer has three purposes.
First, it serves as a demonstration of layering by providing a layer
which does nothing.
(It actually does everything the loopback file system does,
which is slightly more than nothing.)
Second, it is used for NFS exporting.
Third, the null layer can serve as a prototype layer.
Since it provides all necessary layer framework,
new file system layers can be created very easily by starting
with a null layer.
