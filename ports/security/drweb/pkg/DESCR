Dr.Web Daemon is an antivirus daemon, that in point of fact is an improved
antivirus scanner. But in contrast to the scanner loading bases and the
scanning module at every new start, the daemon loads these components
only once, when starting, and is always ready in the memory awaiting the
next scanning task. Besides, the daemon can carry out a few scans
simultaneously which provides on average faster response. In other respects
Dr.Web Daemon has the same facilities as the other products of the Dr.Web
family:

- it uses the kernel and the virus base used by all the other scanners of
the family;
- detects and cures all the known viruses; 
- performs scanning of packed files and archives.
Besides, recently the option of mail filtering based on header analyzing
has been added in Dr.Web Daemon.

The fact that the daemon is always ready to function and has a comprehensible
and accessible protocol for scanning requests makes it a suitable
component for creating antivirus filters for mail systems and file servers.
Developers of Dr.Web suggest the ready solutions on integration Dr.Web Daemon
with CommuniGatePro, Sendmail, Postfix, Exim, QMail and Zmailer mail
systems, and also the solution on integrating with Samba file servers.
There may obviously be other fields of application of Dr.Web Daemon,
although the listed ones are by now the principal ones.
