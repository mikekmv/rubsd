To use this fonts in GhostScript, you need to modify GhostScript's
fontmap file. We provide patch files for common GhostScript versions,
that are awailable in ports. For example, do this as root:

	patch -p0 < ${PREFIX}/share/ps-cyr/gs-6.51-Fontmap.patch

Note, that you will need to start GhostScript with -dNOPLATFONTS
option. If you are using GhostView or GV try to set up environment
variable GS_OPTIONS with the -dNOPLATFONTS value. Or, if you
are using GV add -dNOPLATFONTS to the GV.gsX11Device or
GV.gsX11AlphaDevice resource in your GV configuration file ~/.gv

To use this Type1 fonts in your XFree86, add following line to
your XF86Config file:

	FontPath "${PREFIX}/share/ps-cyr/"

Or use ``xset  fp+'' to do this for the current X-session.
