XZX-Pro is a portable emulator of ZX Spectrum 48K/128K/+3
(8-bit home computers made by Sir Clive Sinclair) and
Spectrum clones, for machines running UNIX and the X Window
system. XZX-Pro is completely written in C. It initially
was based on XZX 1.0.2 by Des Herriott, but has been
completely rewritten since then.

This is an evaluation version.
