Eggdrop is an IRC bot, written in C. If you don't know what
IRC is, this is probably not whatever you're looking for!
being a bot, sits on a channel and takes protective measures 
to keep the channel from being taken over (in the few ways 
that anything can), to recognize banished users or sites and 
reject them, to recognize privileged users and let them gain 
ops, etc.
