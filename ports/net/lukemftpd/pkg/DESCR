lukemftpd is the Internet File Transfer Protocol server process.  The
server uses the TCP protocol and listens at the port specified in the
``ftp'' service specification; see services(5).

Various features such as the ftpd.conf(5) functionality, RFC 2389, and
draft-ietf-ftpext-mlst-11 support was implemented in NetBSD 1.3 and
later releases by Luke Mewburn <lukem@netbsd.org>.

lukemftpd provides around 90% of the functionality of wuftpd, but in
approximately 30% of the footprint.
