mnoGoSearch (formerly known as UdmSearch) is a full-featured
web search engine software for intranet and internet servers.
It consists of two parts. The first is an indexing mechanism
(indexer). The purpose of the indexer is to walk through HTTP,
FTP, NEWS servers or local files, recursively grabbing all
the documents and storing words meta-data about those documents
in an SQL database in a smart and efficient manner. After every
document is referenced by its corresponding URL, meta-data,
collected by the indexer is used later in the search process.
The search is performed via Web interface. C CGI front end,
PHP search script and Perl search script are included.
